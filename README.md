# Machine Learning for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer
---
During this project I have used urine biomarkers data available at [Debernardi et al 2020](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003489) so as to early detect **pancreatic cancer** (as it does not present early symptoms) using ML.

In the notebook, the complete elaboration of the solution with `Python` programming language is shown. More precisely, this code contains the data cleaning, EDA, trial of different algorithms and cases so as to choose the optimal algorithm to detect this complex disease.
